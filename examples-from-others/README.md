I've found a few open-source example projects that aren't hosted
somewhere super convenient for me; I'm vendoring them into this
directory so that it's easier to find them.

What's here:
- fang_1.3.1 is from https://www.haber-kucharsky.com/proj/fang/ which
  has a source tarball, I got it on July 12 2024. It's an impressively
  well-written and well-documented Ocaml compiler for Tiger (the language
  built in Appel's "Modern Compiler Implementation" books).
